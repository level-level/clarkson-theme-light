# Clarkson Theme Light

Clarkson Theme Light is a empty theme which is used in our ["Gettings Started Guide"](http://wp-clarkson.com/guides/).

It's free from tooling and frameworks. If you do want to kickstart your theme project. Head over to our [Clarkson Theme starter theme](https://github.com/level-level/Clarkson-Theme). That theme includes tools like Gulp, BrowserSync and NPM to help you develop modern day themes.

ðŸŽ‰ Enjoy!
